					<h2>Independent Learning</h2>
					<p>
						Throughout this project I have been using my independant learning skills to manage my time with confidence while also allowing myself to have a flexible schedule. Using techniques which allow me to manage my time, whether thats using a planner on my phone, setting reminders or even simply blocking out distractions. Allowed me to direct my full focus on this project. 
					<br>
						It wasn't easy though. Moving to university was a big change and managing my social time while also providing myself with enough time to study was a challenge. I used a planner / diary on my phone to manage my time during the day while also using the library in the Cockcroft building to remove all distractions. When night came around, I allowed myself time to relax and socialise with my friends.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div>
					<p>
						Overall, I believe my time management skills were adequate for me to be able to complete the project before the assigned deadline. While I faced a few hiccups along the way, each week I was able to complete enough work for me to be satisfied with my workload.

				<h2>Digital Skills</h2>
				<p>Another skill I developed throughout this project was my digital skills. Developing and eventually Mastering your digital skills allow you to grasp a full range of techniques that allow you to have the key skills necessary to complete a project to its full requirements.
				</p>
				<p>One Digital skill I developed and used throughout was using the internet in order to improve my understanding on HTML and CSS concepts. I used a range of resources in order to do so. However, one resource I used the most was <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/">W3Schools</a>. This website provided me with an in depth look into each html element and how to use them appropriately while also teaching me new ways to create a webpage (such as flexbox, grid and block displays). Furthermore, another skill I developed upon was my digital problem solving. Throughout this project I faced multiple problems with my code. Display layouts not working correctly, not designing a mobile first website, having to rewrite code so that it was and much more. I had to take it upon myself to solve these problems. It was a challenge. However, using my previous coding knowledge and understanding of computational thinking (such as abstraction and decomposition) I managed to solve each problem and create a fully functional website that validated against industry standards.

				<h2>Referencing Skills</h2>
				<p>
					Referencing is an important skill to use when it comes to creating your own work. Itâ€™s important to acknowledge your sources as this demonstrates the depth of your research and understanding while also avoiding any possible plagiarism. While creating my webpages I used a range of different sources so that I could have a deep understanding of the concepts surrounding web development. While I used W3Schools, I also used the Lab notes and Index provided to me by the university. Using the notes I had taken during lectures, while also using the index provided allowed me to have a firm understanding of what should be included within my webpage. It also allowed me to understand the best way for me to translate my ideas into fruition. I included my references within my footer that is displayed within the Learning Journal page.
